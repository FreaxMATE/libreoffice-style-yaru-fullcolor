## Install

### From extension

Since Libreoffice 6.0, you can install an icon pack with an extension. To do that, simply download the extension from the following link (or use the one generated by the build script at the root of the project):

https://github.com/Jupiter007-43/libreoffice-style-yaru-fullcolor/raw/master/yaru-theme.oxt

Then open it with Libreoffice or, open __Tools__ → __Extension Manager__ (or __Ctrl__ + __Alt__ + __E__) then click on __Add__ and browse for local directory where the extension placed.

### From script

Because it is faster, install from script will be useful if you want to modify the icons and reinstall the pack many times for testing:

```
git clone https://github.com/Jupiter007-43/libreoffice-style-yaru-fullcolor.git
cd libreoffice-style-yaru-fullcolor
./install.sh
```

⚠ Installing from script and extension will duplicate the icon pack into the options, so you should remove one before using the other way.

---

In both case, you need to enable the theme: open the options __Tools__ → __Options__ (or __Alt__ + __F12__) then go to __LibreOffice__ → __View__ → __Icon style__ and select __Yaru__.

## Remove

### Extension

To remove the extension, open __Tools__ → __Extension Manager__ (or __Ctrl__ + __Alt__ + __E__) then select the theme in the list and click on __Remove__. That's it.

### Script

If you want to remove an installation made with the script just execute the remove script at the root of the project:

```
./remove.sh
```
