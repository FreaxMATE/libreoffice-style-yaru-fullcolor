## Install

### From extension

Since Libreoffice 6.0, you can install an icon pack with an extension. To do that, simply download the extention from the following link:

https://github.com/Jupiter007-43/libreoffice-style-yaru-fullcolor/raw/master/yaru-theme.oxt

Then open it with Libreoffice or, open __Tools__ → __Extension Manager__ (or __Ctrl__ + __Alt__ + __E__) ... click __Add__ and browse for local directory where the extension placed.

### From script

Because it is faster, install from script will be useful if you want to modify the icons and reinstall the pack many times for testing:

```
git clone https://github.com/Jupiter007-43/libreoffice-style-yaru-fullcolor.git
cd libreoffice-style-yaru-fullcolor
./install.sh
```

⚠ Installing from script and extension will duplicate the icon pack into the options, so you should remove one before using the other way.

---

In both case, you need to enable the theme: Open the options __Tools__ → __Options__ (or __Alt__ + __F12__) then go to __LibreOffice__ → __View__ → __Icon style__ and select __Yaru__.
